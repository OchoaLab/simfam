\title{Draw random genotypes on a pedigree with known founder genotypes}
\usage{
draw_geno_fam(X, fam)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The genotype matrix of the founders (loci along rows, individuals along columns).
This matrix must have column names that identify each founder (matching codes in \code{fam$id}).
Individuals may be in a different order than \code{fam$id}.
Extra individuals in \code{admix} but absent in \code{fam$id} will be silently ignored.
All values should be in \code{c(0L, 1L, 2L)}; for speed, this code does not check that \code{X} is valid (i.e. fractional values between 0 and 2 may not cause errors).}

\item{fam}{The pedigree data.frame, in plink FAM format.
Only columns \code{id}, \code{pat}, and \code{mat} are required.
Founders must be present, and their \code{pat} and \code{mat} values must be 0 (missing).
Non-founders must have both their parents be non-0.
Parents must appear earlier than their children in the table.}
}
\value{
The random genotype matrix of the entire \code{fam} table, starting from the genotypes of the founders.
The columns of this matrix correspond to \code{fam$id} in that order.
The rows (loci) are the same as in the input \code{X}.
}
\description{
Constructs a random genotype matrix (for all individuals in the provided pedigree FAM table) starting from the genotype matrix of the founders as provided.
}
\examples{
# The smallest pedigree, two parents and a child.
# A minimal fam table with the three required columns.
# Note "mother" and "father" have missing parent IDs (0), while "child" does not
library(tibble)
fam <- tibble(
  id = c('father', 'mother', 'child'),
  pat = c(0, 0, 'father'),
  mat = c(0, 0, 'mother')
)

# genotypes of the parents at 4 loci
X <- cbind( c(1, 2, 0, 2), c(0, 2, 2, 1) )
# Name the parents with same codes as in `fam`
# (order can be different)
colnames( X ) <- c('mother', 'father')
# name loci too
rownames( X ) <- paste0( 'rs', 1:4 )

# Draw the full genotype matrix
X_all <- draw_geno_fam( X, fam )

# This is a 4x3 matrix with column names matching fam$id.
# The parent submatrix equals the input (reordered),
# but now there's random genotypes for the child too
X_all
